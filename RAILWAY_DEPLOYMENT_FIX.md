# Railway Deployment Fix

## Problem
The deployment was failing because of `better-sqlite3` dependency which requires native compilation with `node-gyp`. Since you're using MySQL for your database, SQLite dependencies are not needed.

## Solution

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
1. Run the cleanup script to remove SQLite dependencies:
   ```bash
   node remove-sqlite-deps.js
   bun install
   ```

2. Commit and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove SQLite dependencies for Railway deployment"
   git push
   ```

### Option 2: Use Clean Dockerfile
The `Dockerfile.web.clean` automatically removes problematic dependencies during build:
- Uses `railway.json` configuration
- Automatically excludes native dependencies
- Optimized for web-only deployment

## Files Created/Modified
- `remove-sqlite-deps.js` - Script to clean package.json
- `Dockerfile.web.clean` - Clean Dockerfile without native deps
- `railway.json` - Updated to use clean Dockerfile
- `create-web-package.js` - Alternative web-specific package.json creator

## Verification
After deployment, your app should:
- ✅ Build successfully without node-gyp errors
- ✅ Use MySQL database (not SQLite)
- ✅ Work properly on web and mobile

## Database Configuration
Your app is correctly configured to use MySQL:
- Database: MySQL via `mysql2` package
- Connection: Via environment variables
- Schema: Defined in `backend/database/schema.ts`

The SQLite dependencies were leftover from initial setup and not actually used in your application.
