## Common Patterns Fixed

### Before (Problematic):
```jsx
{condition && (
  <View>
    <Text>Content</Text>
  </View>
)}
```

### After (Fixed):
```jsx
{condition && (
  <View>
    <Text>Content</Text>
  </View>
)}
```

The key fix was ensuring that all conditional rendering blocks that use the `&&` operator are properly closed with `)}` instead of just `}`.

## Prevention Tips

1. **Always use proper JSX closing**: When using conditional rendering with `&&`, ensure the closing parenthesis and brace are properly placed.

2. **Wrap text in Text components**: Never render raw strings directly in Views - always wrap them in `<Text>` components.

3. **Be careful with template literals**: Ensure template literals in JSX evaluate to proper React elements, not raw strings.

4. **Use TypeScript**: TypeScript can help catch some of these issues at compile time.

5. **Test on both platforms**: Some text node issues may only appear on specific platforms (iOS vs Android vs Web).

## Verification

After these fixes, the application should no longer throw "Unexpected text node" errors. All conditional rendering now properly returns React elements or null, preventing raw text from being rendered as children of View components.
